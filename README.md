An demo application created by me for interview purpose. I created this application incredibly fast and completed within 4 days (48 Total working hours).

The concept of this application is so simple and very good. It would be better explained by a video.

I did a few changes to the concept out of my own personal interest and created this app.

I also do have a video explaining how this app works.
